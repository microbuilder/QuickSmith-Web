# QuickSmith-Web
QuickSmith-Web (https://niyeradori.github.io/QuickSmith-Web/index.html) - Runs on Chrome, Safari and Firefox both in Web and Mobile.

This is a web and mobile version of the MS Windows based QuickSmith - https://github.com/niyeradori/quicksmith.
The primary motivation of this port is in response to the numerous requests from users, who are unable to run QuickSmith 
in the newer Operating Systems. We hope that by making QuickSmith independent of Operating System, it can be "future proofed".

About QuickSmith:

QuickSmith is a Smith Chart based linear circuit simulation program.
Some of the features offered by this program are listed below:
- Ladder network, elements are loaded using drag drop method.
- Open and Save functions for schematic files
- Impedance matching
- Frequency/component sweep
- Load impedance interpolation/extrapolation for frequency dependent loads (to do for web version)
- Q factors taken into account for network components
- Amplifier design/analysis using gain/noise circles
- Insertion loss and S21 graphs
- Transmission line parameter calculations
- Constant Conductance, VSWR and Q circles
- Import and Export of data files
- Help files with solved examples of network matching and amplifier design ( to do for web version)
